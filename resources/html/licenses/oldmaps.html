	</h3>
	<hr class=npnm>
	<h2>Common:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Use of the whole map on any other server is completely forbidden unless you get permission from me personally.
		</li>
		<li>
			Using fragments of the map is only allowed if you got permission from any of the original creators of the content in that area.<br>
			If you can't reach the original creator anymore, consider removing that content and using the rest.
		</li>
		<li>
			It is required to state and give credit, in case you are using the whole Map, a Part or Fragments of it.<br>
			Specifically from where it is (mostly in case you use the whole) and/or who created it.
		</li>
		<li>
			Basically, even if you download it, and use it, it's not yours, just simply because this license exists.<br>
			But you are usually completly legally fine as long all you do is private use!<br>
			If not, it's just a matter of getting permission/s.
