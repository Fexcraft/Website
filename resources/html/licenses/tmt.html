			<b>Changes compared to the original</b><br>
			The above License/'Permission' <b>doesn't</b> (completely) apply for the Modified TMT made by <b>Me</b>.<br>
			I took the effort to update TMT back from it's 1.2.5 version to 1.7.10, 1.8, 1.8.9, 1.9, 1.9.4, 1.10.2, 1.11.x, 1.12+ MC,<br>
			I also added some util classes and 'converters' to be able to use Models made for another large Mod ("flans"),<br>
			as well as tools to use TMT models as Items and a custom JSON model format.<br>
			Thus, I made this license to prevent being defenseless against copying of <b>my</b> code.
		</li>
		<div class=sp></div>
		<li>
			<b>Modifications/Changes/Edits</b><br>
			It's allowed to share modified versions of the source/compiled files <b>only if</b> visibly stating that it's a modified version.
		</li>
		<div class=sp></div>
		<li><b>Source Files / Copying of Source</b></li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Do not remove the comments stating who is/was/are the authors, at top of the files.<br>
				Additionally you could leave an link to this license (if it isn't already there).
			</li>
			<li>
				If you want to include <b>my</b> version of TMT into your mod/library/package, sure you could, but you must give <b>credit</b>,<br>
				by either adding to the author/credits list, or simply don't touch the comments/javadoc, or even both.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<div class=sp></div>
		<li>
			<b>Posting</b><br>
			It's <b>not</b> allowed to post this version of TMT 'alone' anywhere, it's supposed to be in a Mod or Library.<br>
			If you include it into your Mod or Library, you should state clearly/visibly that it's using TMT,<br>
			this will also help people searching a Library/Mod with TMT.
		</li>
		<div class=sp></div>
		<li>
			<b>Exceptions</b><br>
			The "utils" sub-package is licensed under the <a href="http://fexcraft.net/license?id=mods">http://fexcraft.net/license?id=mods</a> License.<br>
			It is not part of original TMT, and in most cases TMT should be able work without it.
