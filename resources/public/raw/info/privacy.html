                    <br>If you <b>ARE NOT</b> registered on this website, most probably we don't store any data about you,
                    exception may be data collected by the Advertisements used on this website, for which data they do store,
                    please contact them, usually on a corner of the add should be an information box.
                    <br><br>If you <b>ARE</b> registered on this website, we do store this kind of data:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your E-Mail Adress</li>
                        <li>Your Password (in encrypted/unreadable form)</li>
                        <li>Anything you post publicly on this website, be it on our forums, or comments on any kind of project or where ever it is possible to comment.</li>
                        <li>If we ever add a function to "rate" things, also for obvious reasons your vote will be stored.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    <span style='font-size:24px;'>Why do we store that data?</span>
                    <br>If you <b>ARE NOT</b> registered on this website, as mentioned, we don't, obviously, I do not count in logging of IP adresses which website software <b>may</b> do, nor I'm aware of the need to do such.
                    <br><br>If you <b>ARE</b> registered on this website, we do store this kind of data:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your E-Mail Adress and Your Password: to be able to authentificate if it is <b>YOU</b> who accesses this site to use it's features and services.</li>
                        <li>Yuor posts: ... well, because you posted them to be visible? To state your Opinion? To help someone? Et cetera.</li>
                        <li>Your ratings: for statistics, to display reliable rating data.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    <span style='font-size:24px;'>What if someone breaks in?</span><br>
                    Most stored data is anyway visible publicly (posts/ratings), except for obvious reasons your e-mail adress and password.
                    Passwords additionally are encrypted, so not even staff if they would have access to the database could read it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span style='font-size:24px;'>I don't want my data to be here anymore!</span><br>
                    I get it, but curently we do not have an automated feature for that, you can either request data deletion by using the "button" for that in your User Settings (may not be there yet) or by e-mailing an website admin.

                    <span style='font-size:24px;'>That's all?!</span><br>
                    I thinks so. If you find anything wrong or missing, feel free to contact me.
